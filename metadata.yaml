description: "North and South is a social novel by English writer Elizabeth Gaskell.\
  \ Along with Wives and Daughters (1865) and Cranford (1853), it is one of her best\
  \ known novels and has been adapted for television twice, in 1975 and 2004. The\
  \ latter version renewed interest in the novel and gained it a wider audience.\n\
  While Gaskell's first novel Mary Barton (1848) focused on relations between employers\
  \ and workers in Manchester from the perspective of the working poor, North and\
  \ South uses a protagonist from southern England to present and comment on the perspectives\
  \ of both mill owners and mill workers.\nNorth and South is set in the fictional\
  \ industrial town of Milton in the North of England. Forced to leave her home in\
  \ the tranquil rural south, Margaret Hale settles with her parents in Milton where\
  \ she witnesses the brutal world wrought by the industrial revolution and employers\
  \ and workers clashing in the first organised strikes. Sympathetic to the poor whose\
  \ courage and tenacity she admires and among whom she makes friends, she clashes\
  \ with John Thornton, a cotton mill manufacturer who belongs to the nouveaux riches\
  \ and whose contemptuous attitude to workers Margaret despises. The novel traces\
  \ both her growing understanding of the complexity of labor relations and her impact\
  \ on some well-meaning mill owners, and the conflicted relationship between Margaret\
  \ Hale and John Thornton.\nGaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester,\
  \ where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
